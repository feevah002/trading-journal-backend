This project will be created with the goal of helping traders easily keep track of their trades and backtest their strategies. 

The website allows users to capture and organize important trade information such as screenshots and notes, making it easier to review and analyze trading history.

Features of the website will include:

- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and data entry
- Ability to track trades and analyze performance over time
- Backtesting capabilities to evaluate trading strategies
- Customizable trade categories to fit individual trading styles
- Secure login and data storage to protect user privacy

I'm passionate about empowering traders with the tools they need to succeed, and I'm excited to share this project with the community. Please feel free to contribute to the project or provide feedback. Thank you for your interest!
